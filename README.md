# Retail Sales Data Analysis & Customer Segmentation  
**Project:** End-to-end analysis of retail transactions with customer segmentation.

## Project Overview

Key questions addressed:  
- Who are the top customers?  
- Which product categories or descriptions drive the most revenue?  
- How do discounts/returns affect sales?  
- What customer segments exist and what actions should the business take?
